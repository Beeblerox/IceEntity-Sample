IceEntity-Sample
================

Really, really simple demo of IceEntity. [NOT FUN]

Meant more as something to read through and see usage, shows off some features that may not be explained (clearly) in the main readme.

Note that nearly all code is contained in the "assets" folder, and supports live-reloading.

You'll mainly want to check out:

**assets\data\Entities.xml**

**assets\data\scripts\IcicleManager.hx**

and:

**Project.xml (IMPORTANT STUFF HERE)**
